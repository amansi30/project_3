Develop a predictive model to identify and classify fraudulent transactions based on a dataset containing various features related to transaction details. The objective is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict and classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on the provided features. The model should be capable of generalizing well to new, unseen data and should be evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
Performed EDA, feature engineering, data cleaning.
Performed various machine learning algorthims- Logistic regression, Decison tree, Decison tree with pre pruning, Random forest, Adaboost classifier, Gradient boosting, Bagging classifer, XGBoost Classifier
XG Boost Classifier demonstrates consistent and strong performance across both training and testing datasets. It achieves high accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores on both datasets, indicating its effectiveness in fraud detection tasks. Additionally, XG Boost is known for its efficiency, scalability, and ability to handle complex datasets, making it a suitable choice for this task. Therefore, the XG Boost Classifier is chosen as the preferred algorithm for fraud detection based on its strong performance and suitability for the task.
Identified 'ConnectionOrg' as a significant predictor of fraudulent transactions, suggesting certain organizations may pose higher risks. Positive correlations observed in 'V6CF', 'Country', 'webSessWebBrowser', and 'webSessOS', though less pronounced, provide additional insights into potential fraud factors.
